## Methodology

### A. Proposed Work

The proposed system delineates a ForensicChain: blockchain-based digital forensic evidence management framework designed to maintain the integrity, authenticity and transparency of digital evidence throughout its lifecycle. In contrast to the conventional centralized systems, which can be vulnerable to unauthorized changes and data loss, the blockchain model provides a tamper-proof and decentralized ledger that carefully records entire activity related to evidence management in an immutable manner.

By using the core features of blockchain technology, such as immutability, distributed consensus and cryptographic security, the proposed framework effectively protects the chain of custody for digital evidence. Each evidence file is transformed into a unique cryptographic hash (SHA-256), acting as a distinct digital fingerprint. This hash along with important metadata is then added to the blockchain. Smart contracts help automate key processes, like registering evidence, transferring custody and validating records, ensuring that all transactions are consistent, auditable, and secure from tampering.

Ethereum, one of the most widely adopted blockchain platforms, is selected for implementation because of its robust support for programmable smart contracts and strong developer community. The Sepolia test network within Ethereum is used as the deployment environment, powered by the Alchemy blockchain infrastructure. The Foundry framework is used for writing, testing and deploying smart contracts, while MetaMask acts as the digital wallet for efficient transaction management. Together, these tools create an experimental setup to test the effectiveness of a blockchain-based approach to evidence management in digital forensics.

### B. System Architecture

The proposed system is designed using a three-layered architecture that integrates evidence acquisition, blockchain management and user interface. This layered design ensures modularity, transparency and security while preserving the integrity of digital forensic evidence.

**1) Evidence Acquisition Layer:**  
At the initial phase, investigators collect and prepare digital evidence for uploading onto the system. Each evidence file undergoes cryptographic processing, wherein a unique hash value is generated using SHA-256 algorithm. This layer incorporates several critical components:

_Evidence Collection Protocol:_ Digital artifacts are systematically gathered from various sources including computer systems, mobile devices, network logs, and IoT devices. Each piece of evidence is assigned a unique identifier and timestamp to maintain chronological order.

_Cryptographic Processing:_ The SHA-256 hashing algorithm generates a unique digital fingerprint for each evidence file, ensuring data integrity verification. Additional metadata including file size, creation date, collection timestamp, and investigator credentials are also captured and hashed.

_Pre-processing Validation:_ Before blockchain submission, evidence files undergo validation checks to ensure completeness, format compliance, and initial integrity verification. This step prevents corrupted or incomplete data from entering the blockchain ledger.

**2) Blockchain Management Layer**
This layer serves as the core of the ForensicChain framework, where the cryptographic hashes of evidence files and their associated metadata are permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Utilizing the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, transactions are processed through smart contracts programmed with Foundry. These smart contracts automate the registration of new evidence, transfer and verification of custody, and validation of all related records to ensure integrity, transparency, and immutability.

_Smart Contract Functionality:_ The smart contracts, written in Solidity, implement essential forensic procedures including evidence registration, custody transfer protocols, access control mechanisms, and audit trail generation. Each transaction is cryptographically signed and requires consensus from network nodes before being permanently recorded.

_Consensus Mechanism:_ The Ethereum blockchain employs a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism that ensures all network participants agree on the validity of transactions, providing distributed trust without requiring a central authority.

_Immutable Storage:_ Once evidence metadata and hashes are recorded on the blockchain, they become immutable and tamper-proof, creating an unalterable audit trail that satisfies legal requirements for chain of custody.

**3) User Interface Layer**
The user interface provides investigators, forensic experts, and authorized personnel with an intuitive and secure dashboard to interact with the system. This layer leverages MetaMask wallet integration to facilitate smooth blockchain transactions, allowing users to register evidence, transfer custody, and validate records seamlessly.

_Role-Based Access Control:_ The system implements hierarchical access control mechanisms ensuring that only authorized entities can perform specific actions based on their roles and clearance levels. This includes investigators, lab technicians, legal counsel, and court officials, each with predefined permissions.

_Transaction Management:_ Through MetaMask integration, users can initiate blockchain transactions for evidence operations while maintaining cryptographic security. All user interactions are logged and verified through digital signatures.

_Audit and Reporting Interface:_ The system provides comprehensive reporting capabilities, allowing users to generate chain of custody reports, access logs, and integrity verification reports required for legal proceedings.

### C. Security and Transparency Framework
The framework guarantees the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence through multiple security layers. The cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) of each evidence file acts as a unique digital fingerprint stored immutably on the blockchain. The distributed nature of the Ethereum blockchain eliminates single points of failure, enhancing the system's resistance to data loss, tampering, and unauthorized modifications.

_Cryptographic Security:_ All evidence files and metadata are protected using industry-standard cryptographic protocols, including SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification and digital signatures for authentication.

_Decentralized Trust:_ The blockchain's distributed consensus mechanism ensures that no single entity can manipulate evidence records, providing trustless verification of all forensic operations.

_Transparency and Auditability:_ Every transaction and access event is permanently recorded on the blockchain, creating a complete and auditable trail that can be independently verified by all stakeholders.

### D. Implementation and Testing Framework
The system prototype is developed and deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet using the Foundry development framework for smart contract implementation. Performance evaluation focuses on transaction throughput, latency, gas consumption, and scalability under various load conditions.

_Testing Methodology:_ Controlled testing environments simulate real-world forensic scenarios, including evidence submission, custody transfers, and integrity verification processes. Metrics include system response time, blockchain confirmation delays, and resource utilization.

_Validation Criteria:_ The system's effectiveness is measured against traditional evidence management systems based on security, transparency, immutability, and operational efficiency parameters.

This comprehensive methodology ensures that the ForensicChain framework addresses the critical requirements of digital forensic evidence management while leveraging blockchain technology's inherent security and transparency features.
