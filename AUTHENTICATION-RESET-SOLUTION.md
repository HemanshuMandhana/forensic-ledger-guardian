# Authentication Reset Solution

## Problem Summary

You were experiencing an issue where logging in with Court email/password wasn't resetting the wallet address and role, which remained stuck on the Officer role from development mode.

## Root Cause

The application was in development mode, which automatically sets a default Officer user (`dev-officer`) in localStorage. When switching between different login methods (email/password vs wallet), the previous authentication state wasn't being properly cleared.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Context (`/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Changes made:**

- **Login function**: Now clears any existing dev/wallet user data before attempting email login
- **Wallet login function**: Now properly clears any existing email-based session before wallet authentication
- **Development mode initialization**: More intelligent initialization that respects active sessions
- **Logout function**: Enhanced to clear all authentication state regardless of login method

### 2. Authentication Utilities (`/src/utils/authUtils.ts`)

Created utility functions for:

- `clearAllAuthData()`: Clears all authentication-related data from storage
- `isDevUser()`: Checks if current user is a development user
- `forceAuthReset()`: Forces complete authentication reset with page reload

### 3. Authentication Reset Button (`/src/components/auth/AuthResetButton.tsx`)

Created a reset button component that:

- Appears only in development mode or for dev users
- Completely clears all authentication state
- Forces a clean restart of the authentication flow
- Provides user feedback during the reset process

### 4. UI Integration

**Login Form** (`/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`):

- Added import for AuthResetButton
- Added reset button to footer in development mode

**Role Debugger** (`/src/components/debug/RoleDebugger.tsx`):

- Added reset button next to the refresh button for easy access during debugging

## How to Use the Solution

### For immediate fix:

1. **Option 1**: Use the new "Reset Login" button that appears on the login page (in development mode)
2. **Option 2**: Use the "Reset Login" button in the Role Debugger component
3. **Option 3**: Clear browser localStorage manually and refresh

### For Court Administrator login:

1. Click "Reset Login" to clear any stuck authentication state
2. Enter your Court email and password
3. The system will now properly clear the Officer role and authenticate with Court credentials
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard with Court permissions

### For switching between login methods:

- The system now automatically clears previous authentication state when switching between:
  - Email/password login ↔ Wallet login
  - Development user ↔ Real user authentication
  - Different user roles

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow Improvements:

1. **Email Login**: Clears localStorage before Supabase authentication
2. **Wallet Login**: Signs out of Supabase session before wallet authentication
3. **Development Mode**: Checks for active sessions before setting dev user
4. **Logout**: Clears both Supabase session and localStorage

### State Management:

- All authentication state is properly reset between login methods
- localStorage is cleared of old authentication data
- Development mode doesn't interfere with production authentication

## Testing the Fix

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. You should see a "Reset Login" button at the bottom (in dev mode)
4. Click it to clear all authentication state
5. Now try logging in with Court credentials
6. The system should properly authenticate with Court role instead of Officer

## Prevention for Future

The enhanced authentication context now:

- Automatically handles state cleanup when switching login methods
- Provides better separation between development and production authentication
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback
- Maintains consistency across different authentication flows

This solution ensures that authentication state is properly managed and users can switch between different login methods without getting stuck in previous roles or authentication states.
