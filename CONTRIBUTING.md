## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Foundry (for smart contract development)
- Basic understanding of:
  - React/TypeScript
  - Blockchain development
  - IPFS and decentralized storage

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/forensic-ledger-guardian.git
   cd forensic-ledger-guardian
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd ipfs_backend/ipfs-backend && npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables (see README.md)
5. Start development servers

## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Testing improvements

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing
- `chore`: Maintenance

Example:
```
feat(evidence): add batch upload functionality

Implemented batch upload feature allowing users to upload multiple evidence files simultaneously with progress tracking.

Closes #123
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if necessary
5. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - List of breaking changes (if any)

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional programming patterns

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript
- Follow component composition patterns
- Use consistent file naming (PascalCase for components)

### Smart Contracts

- Follow Solidity style guide
- Use NatSpec documentation
- Implement comprehensive access controls
- Add events for important state changes
- Include proper error messages

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utilities
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain consistent color schemes
- Use semantic class names

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Include integration tests for complex workflows
- Test accessibility features

### Smart Contract Testing

- Use Foundry for contract testing
- Test all public functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test access control mechanisms
- Verify gas optimization

### Backend Testing

- Test API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error handling
- Verify security measures

## Security Considerations

### Code Review Requirements

- All code must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require additional review
- Smart contract changes must be thoroughly audited

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit private keys or secrets
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure coding practices
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Implement proper error handling

### Reporting Security Issues

Report security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers. Do not create public issues for security problems.

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Update README when adding features
- Document configuration options

### Architecture Documentation

- Update architecture diagrams for structural changes
- Document data flow for new features
- Explain design decisions in comments

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Test all functionality
4. Create release PR
5. Tag release after merge

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Ask questions in pull request comments
- Contact maintainers for guidance
- Join community discussions

## Recognition
